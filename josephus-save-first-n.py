# Concrete Mathematics problem 1.21:
# Suppose there are 2n people in a circle; the first n are "good guys"
# and the last n are "bad guys".
# In the problem we show there is always a q such that executing every q-th person
# get all the bad guys first. Namely, the least common multiple of n+1, n+2, ..., 2n
# will work.
# However, a smaller q can (always?) be found.
# e.g. for n = 3, q = 5 suffices, less than lcm(4,5,6) = 60.

# submitted to OEIS as A343780
